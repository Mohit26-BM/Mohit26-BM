#  Hello, I'm Mohit!

 I'm currently pursuing a **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** at **Lovely Professional University**, Punjab. My primary passion lies in **Data Science**, where I enjoy diving into data, uncovering patterns, and building solutions that drive meaningful, data-informed decisions.


##  What I'm About

-  **Aspiring Data Analyst**: I thrive at the intersection of data, technology, and storytelling. Whether it's wrangling datasets or building insightful dashboards, I love transforming raw information into powerful insights.
-  **Tech Stack**: Skilled in tools like **Tableau**, **SQL (PostgreSQL & Oracle)**, **Python**, and various data analysis workflows.
-  **Culturally Curious**: My love for cultures extends to languages. I’ve been trying to learn **German** and **French** on **Duolingo** and doing courses on **Udemy**, which has been a rewarding journey into new ways of thinking and expression.
-  **Avid Reader**: I enjoy exploring both **historical narratives**—like the strategies of **Hannibal Barca**, **Napoleon**, and the complexities of **World Wars I & II**—and **cosmic mysteries**, through books like *A Brief History of Time*.
  

##  Always Learning

I believe in continuous growth—currently enhancing my skills in **machine learning**, **ETL pipelines**, and **cloud technologies**. I'm also active on platforms like **Coursera** and **Duolingo** to stay sharp and explore new domains.
