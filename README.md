# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohit!

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** at **Lovely Professional University**, Punjab. My primary passion lies in **Data Science**, where I enjoy diving into data, uncovering patterns, and building solutions that drive meaningful, data-informed decisions.


## 💡 What I'm About

- 🔬 **Aspiring Data Scientist**: I thrive at the intersection of data, technology, and storytelling. Whether it's wrangling datasets or building insightful dashboards, I love transforming raw information into powerful insights.
- 📊 **Tech Stack**: Skilled in tools like **Tableau**, **SQL (PostgreSQL & Oracle)**, **Python**, and various data analysis workflows.
- 🌍 **Culturally Curious**: My love for cultures extends to languages. I’ve been trying to learn **German** and **French** on **Duolingo** and doing courses on **Udemy**, which has been a rewarding journey into new ways of thinking and expression.
- 📚 **Avid Reader**: I enjoy exploring both **historical narratives**—like the strategies of **Hannibal Barca**, **Napoleon**, and the complexities of **World Wars I & II**—and **cosmic mysteries**, through books like *A Brief History of Time* and *Black Holes: The Key to Understanding the Universe*.
  

## 🚀 Always Learning

I believe in continuous growth—currently enhancing my skills in **machine learning**, **ETL pipelines**, and **cloud technologies**. I'm also active on platforms like **Coursera** and **Duolingo** to stay sharp and explore new domains.
